Description: cryptocoin client for Lethean network - daemon and tools
 Full Lethean client is a full-node wallet for the Lethean network.
 .
 Lethean (LTHN) is an open-source cryptocurrency
 that provides blockchain backed, distributed VPN services.
 Lethean uses a public ledger to record transactions
 while new units are created through a process called mining.
 Lethean aims to improve on existing cryptocurrency design
 by obscuring sender, recipient and amount of every transaction made
 as well as making the mining process more egalitarian.
 .
 This package provides the daemon letheand for Full Lethean client,
 and command-line tools to interact with the daemon.

 Beware that full global transaction history (blockchain) is stored locally,
 which may require very large amounts of disk space.
